# TWML project, Spring 2022: Adversarial Best Arm Identification in Gaussian Bandits

This is coded in MATLAB R2022a. For obtaining the plots:

# Synthetic data:
Run the "plot_normal.m" file to obtain the plot in the presentation. Make sure that the data files "SE_median.mat", "SE_trimmed.mat" and "rSPRT.mat" are loaded. Each of these data files have been obtained by running the files "rTTSPRT.m", "SE_median_synthetic.m" and "SE_trimmed_mean_synthetic.m". 

# Real data (PKIS2):
Run the "plot_PKIS2.m" file to obtain the plot in the presentation. Additionally, the data in the plot file has been obtained using "rTT_SPRT_PKIS2.m", "SE_trimmed_mean_PKIS2.m" and "SE_median_PKIS2.m".
